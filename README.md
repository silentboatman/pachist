Pachist
=======

A small program written in bash to show installed package history in Arch Linux. It can be used by it's own by simply write 'pachist' on the command line or run directly after another command like 'yaourt -Syua --devel --noconfirm && pachist'. I also added a verbose prefix "pachist -v" as it can sometimes be good to show install messages.

Usage: pachist [options] [number of lines]

	options:

	-h, --help              Show this help
	    --err               Not as verbose, just warning messages
	-q, --quiet             Show less information
	-v, --verbose           Show verbose messages
	-V, --version           Show current version
	<number>                The number of lines to show.
                                
        Numbers also have support to show range of lines. The syntax is either <n> for total number of lines
        or <n>,<n> for a range were the first number before the comma tells which line from the bottom to
        start with and the number after the comma describes the total number of lines to show. It can
        be very usefull together with the -q flag.


The configuration file can be found at ~/.config/pachist.conf and currently holds ability to change default colors and number of lines to be shown.
